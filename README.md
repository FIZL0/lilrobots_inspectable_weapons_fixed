# lilrobots_inspectable_weapons_fixed
Fixes issues with lilrobot's inspectable weapons script for BO3 Custom Zombies.

Changes:
Added checks for sprinting and sliding.
Changed Inspect Key to Reload Input.

In the original script there were issues with getting stuck inspecting while sprinting or sliding, I've fixed those issues and would love for other maps to not have those bugs either. Feel free to use while still crediting lilrobot.
